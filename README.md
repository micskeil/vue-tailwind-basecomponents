# vue-tailwind-basecomponents

A Functional Vue Component Library with Personalization in Mind.

We prioritize functionality over design. Our goal is to provide developers with a range of components that can be easily customized to fit any Vue project. By focusing on layout styling and minimal design choices, users have the flexibility to personalize each component according to their preferences and seamlessly integrate them into their Vue applications.

You can enjoy a vast collection of thoughtfully crafted components, from essential elements to interactive widgets. We understand that every Vue project is unique, and our library aims to empower developers to build exceptional user experiences by offering powerful and customizable functionality.

[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) (and disable Vetur) + [TypeScript Vue Plugin (Volar)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.vscode-typescript-vue-plugin).

## Type Support for `.vue` Imports in TS

TypeScript cannot handle type information for `.vue` imports by default, so we replace the `tsc` CLI with `vue-tsc` for type checking. In editors, we need [TypeScript Vue Plugin (Volar)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.vscode-typescript-vue-plugin) to make the TypeScript language service aware of `.vue` types.

If the standalone TypeScript plugin doesn't feel fast enough to you, Volar has also implemented a [Take Over Mode](https://github.com/johnsoncodehk/volar/discussions/471#discussioncomment-1361669) that is more performant. You can enable it by the following steps:

1. Disable the built-in TypeScript Extension
    1) Run `Extensions: Show Built-in Extensions` from VSCode's command palette
    2) Find `TypeScript and JavaScript Language Features`, right click and select `Disable (Workspace)`
2. Reload the VSCode window by running `Developer: Reload Window` from the command palette.
